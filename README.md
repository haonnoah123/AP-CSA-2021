# AP-CSA-2021

## Hawaiian Words
* Hawaiian Words was a project assigned which intends to translate a Hawaiian Word into the pronunciation. It was by far the hardest project I worked on during AP CSA and helped me develop debugging and trouble shooting skills. It also really helped challenge my orginization skills while coding, and helped me understand why it is important to add comments to code.

## Hangman
* Hangman was a really fun project to work on because it could be played once finished. It was a relatively simple challenge, which involved using different classes and objects to code a game of hangman.
